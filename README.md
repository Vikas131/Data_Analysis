# Data Analysis Projects

## Overview

This repository contains data analysis projects focused on extracting insights from stock market data, movie data, and sales data. 
The projects utilize real-time APIs, specifically Yahoo Finance, to gather relevant data for analysis and visualization.

## Projects

### 1. Stock Market Analysis
